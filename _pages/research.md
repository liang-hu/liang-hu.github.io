## Research Interests
My research tries to address fundamental challenges of autonomy, safety and security in autonomous sytems and robotics. To achive that, I have been developing a systemetic approach that integrates control theory, Bayesian estimation and machine learning techniques seamlessly. 

## Safe Autonomous Navigation in Shared Environments
* Safe human robots interaction is an promising technique to assure the safety of autonomous systems that run in shared environements with human users.
